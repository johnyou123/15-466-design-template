<h1>Power Snake</h1>
<p>A Traditional snake game with powerups</p>
<!-- the <div> wrapping this image centers it on the page. -->
<!-- TODO: drawing showing the main view of the game during play -->
<div class="figure">
<img src="game.png" />
</div>
<p>The snake moves around the square arena using arrow keys. When it hits itself or a wall, it's game over. Collecting apples gives points, but makes the snake longer/faster. Collect powerups to gain powers. </p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Game start: The snake starts around the middle and the game starts when the first arrow key is pressed. </p>
<p>Game end: Game ends when the snake dies either by hitting its own body or a wall or eats a poison apple.</p>
<p>Gameplay: Use arrow keys to turn the snake in the direction pressed. When a star is collected, press A to change directions (more below) </p>
<p> Powerups:</p>
Apple - Increase length of snake by 1, make snake move faster, earn points<p>
Poison Apple - Instant game over. Avoid.<p>
Portal - Teleport from one portal to another. Spawns in pairs (maybe multiple colors). Snake teleports one segment at a time. Portals randomly go away.<p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
Star - The snake gains another head. Press A to change directions and start moving using the other head as the front. This will only last a short amount of time.<p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
The powerups spawn randomly. At least one apple will always be on the board. Powerups will not spawn on top of the snake. All power ups give points, as well as surviving for intervals of time.

Poison apples will spawn more often as the game progresses.
